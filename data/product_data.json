            "description": "This lower spray arm assembly in your dishwasher distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle by spinning around and spraying water in different directions. You can usually find it attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. If this part is broken, you might notice some signs. You might hear a knocking or banging sound coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may not rotate properly or might seem wobbly. It is important to replace a damaged arm assembly as your dishes will not get cleaned properly, and they will still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. It can also cause the dishwasher to have a bad smell because of leftover food residue. To remove your existing arm assembly, you will need to release its locking mechanism before lifting it out of your appliance. Please be informed that this OEM-verified part is sold individually.",
